      liblog is a reliable, high-performance, thread safe, flexible, clear-model, pure C logging library.
      Actually, in the C world there was NO good logging library for applications like logback in java or
      log4cxx in c++. Using printf can work, but can not be redirected or reformatted easily.
      syslog is slow and is designed for system use. So I wrote liblog. It is faster, safer and more powerful than log4c.
      So it can be widely used.

config LIBLOG_COLOR

    default n
    help
      liblog supports colored output.
